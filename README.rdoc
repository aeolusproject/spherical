= Spherical

Spherical provides access to VMware vSphere servers and their resources via a self-contained Ruby gem. It provides the following features/benefits:

* Small number of dependencies; only relies on savon and xmlsimple
* Utilizes meta-programming wherever possible to introspect server-side operations and data structures, enabling simple adaptation to changes in the vSphere API.
* Abstracts away complex traversals of vSphere tree structures, as well as access to properties, etc.
* Covers almost the entire vSphere API -- if you can do it directly with the vSphere SOAP API, you can do it with Spherical.

== Requirements

When installing Spherical, the following gems will be installed automatically if they are not already:

* savon -- a library providing simplified access to WSDL endpoints
* xmlsimple -- a robust XML parsing library that converts even complex XML to simple native data structures.
* rspec -- spec testing support

== Logging

Logging of SOAP requests can be turned on or off by setting the environment
variable SPHERICAL_LOGGING to a log level (one of the log levels supported
by Logger, i.e. FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO or DEBUG)
