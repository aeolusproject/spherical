  # ManagedReference provides an abstraction layer for managing VMware
  # ManagedObjectReferences. The VMware SOAP API provides client-side access
  # to "object-oriented" server-side resources (within the context of the
  # session) by returning references to those objects, upon which SOAP
  # methods can be called, properties can be retrieved, etc.
  #
  # ManagedReferences are identified by an ID string that is unique per
  # type and vSphere installation. ManagedReference tracks all
  # ManagedObjectReferences, and provides common mechanisms for access to
  # properties, structure traversal, and dynamic typing. In addition,
  # ManagedReference can be subclassed to extend Ruby functionality for
  # specific ManagedObjectReference types.
  #
  # Ruby classes are dynamically defined for each ManagedObjectReference type
  # as they are instantiated and returned to the client. This means that,
  # even if ManagedReference hasn't been subclassed for a specific type (i.e.
  # that type has been defined), returned ManagedObjectReferences will still
  # behave as objects in Ruby -- methods can be called on them, properties
  # can be accessed, etc.
