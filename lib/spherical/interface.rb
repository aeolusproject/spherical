    # Coerce a structured hash to XML via a provided Builder instance, with
    # native support for coercions of Managed Object References.
    #
    # The following rules apply when converting hashes to XML:
    # * If any hash value is a managed reference of any type, it will be
    #   automatically converted to XML as a +ManagedObjectReference+. The key
    #   that it is associated with will become the name of the tag.
    #
    #   <tt>{:obj => my_folder}</tt> becomes
    #   <tt><vim25:obj xsi:type="vim25:ManagedObjectReference">Folder-0</vim25:obj></tt>
    #
    # * Hashes can optionally contain two special keys: +content!+ and
    #   +attributes!+. These allow finer grained control of the output by
    #   allowing you to specify tag attributes, and when content should be
    #   taken literally rather than being subject to coercion. If no
    #   +:content!+ key is provided, keys will be represented as tags, and
    #   coerced recursively.
    #
    #   <tt>{:name => 'ken', :age => 10}</tt> becomes
    #   <tt><vim25:name>ken</vim25:name><vim25:age>10</vim25:age></tt>
    #
    # * Hash values for which an array is provided will be converted to a
    #   set of tags whose names match the key pointing to the array.
    #
    #   <tt>{:name => ['ken', 'tigger']}</tt> becomes
    #   <tt><vim25:name>ken</vim25:name><vim25:name>tigger</vim25:name></tt>
